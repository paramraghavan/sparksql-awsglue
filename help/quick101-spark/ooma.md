Spark job is going out of memeory and getting killed:
I am using :

```

spark = SparkSession.builder
.appName("Long Running Notebook")
.config("spark.driver.memory", "30g")
.config("spark.driver.maxResultSize", "8g")
.config("spark.cleaner.periodicGC.interval", "15min")
.config("spark.network.timeout", "800s")
.config("spark.executor.heartbeatInterval", "60s")
.getOrCreate()

will teh folowing conif help
spark = SparkSession.builder

.config("spark.memory.fraction", 0.8)
.config("spark.memory.storageFraction", 0.3)
.config("spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin", "false")
.config("spark.speculation", "true")
.getOrCreate()

fix such that my job completes, my EMR cluster i s 1 master, 1 core, 58 task nodes

- Master node: r5.4xlarge - Core node: r5.12xlarge (for HDFS if needed)
- Task nodes: r5.16xlarge

```
```

Looking at your current configuration, you're allocating 30GB for the driver memory and limiting result size to 8GB,
with some garbage collection and timeout settings. Your proposed new configuration focuses on memory fractions and join
behavior but doesn't address the driver memory allocation.

Given your cluster setup (1 master r5.4xlarge, 1 core r5.12xlarge, and 58 task r5.16xlarge nodes), here's a more
comprehensive configuration that should help prevent memory issues:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder
.appName("Memory Optimized Job")
.config("spark.driver.memory", "25g")
.config("spark.driver.maxResultSize", "5g")
.config("spark.executor.memory", "45g")
.config("spark.executor.memoryOverhead", "10g")
.config("spark.memory.fraction", 0.8)
.config("spark.memory.storageFraction", 0.3)
.config("spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled", "true")
.config("spark.shuffle.service.enabled", "true")
.config("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
.config("spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled", "true")
.config("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", "100MB")
.config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 1000)
.config("spark.default.parallelism", 1000)
.config("spark.cleaner.periodicGC.interval", "1min")
.config("spark.network.timeout", "1200s")
.config("spark.executor.heartbeatInterval", "120s")
.getOrCreate()
```

This configuration includes:

1. Appropriate memory settings for driver and executors based on your r5 instances
2. Memory overhead allocation to handle non-JVM memory usage
3. Dynamic allocation to adjust resources as needed
4. Adaptive query execution to optimize complex operations
5. Optimized shuffle partitions to balance memory usage
6. More aggressive garbage collection to free up memory
7. Extended timeouts to prevent job failures during lengthy operations

Additionally, you might want to implement these coding practices in your job:

1. Cache/persist only necessary DataFrames and unpersist them when no longer needed
2. Use broadcast joins for small tables (under 100MB)
3. Consider using repartitioning strategically to control partition sizes
4. Monitor memory consumption with Spark UI and adjust accordingly

## REsource alloca details

Let me dive deeper into these configurations and explain why they'll help prevent your Spark job from running out of
memory:

## Memory Configuration Explained

1. **Driver Memory Settings**
    - `spark.driver.memory`: Set to 25g instead of 30g to leave some headroom for the OS on your master node (r5.4xlarge
      has 128GB RAM)
    - `spark.driver.maxResultSize`: Limited to 5g to prevent large collections from overwhelming the driver

2. **Executor Memory Settings**
    - `spark.executor.memory`: 45g allocates memory for JVM heap on each executor (r5.16xlarge has 512GB RAM)
    - `spark.executor.memoryOverhead`: 10g reserves additional non-heap memory for Python processes, native libraries,
      and other overhead

3. **Memory Management**
    - `spark.memory.fraction`: 0.8 means 80% of heap memory is used for storage and execution, leaving 20% for user data
      structures and internal metadata
    - `spark.memory.storageFraction`: 0.3 means 30% of the usable memory is reserved for storage (cached data), while
      70% is for execution (shuffle, joins, aggregations)

## Resource Allocation

1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
    - `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled`: Automatically adjusts the number of executors based on workload
    - `spark.shuffle.service.enabled`: Required for dynamic allocation to work properly, keeps shuffle data available
      when executors are removed

2. **Adaptive Query Execution**
    - `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled`: Dynamically optimizes query execution plans at runtime
    - `spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled`: Handles data skew in joins by splitting and redistributing skewed
      partitions

## Parallelism and Partitioning

1. **Partition Management**
    - `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`: 1000 partitions distribute work across your 58 task nodes
    - `spark.default.parallelism`: Matching the shuffle partitions ensures consistent parallelism
    - `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`: 100MB allows moderately-sized tables to be broadcast, reducing shuffle
      operations

2. **GC and Timeouts**
    - `spark.cleaner.periodicGC.interval`: More frequent garbage collection (1min) helps free memory
    - `spark.network.timeout` and `spark.executor.heartbeatInterval`: Extended to prevent node failures during
      long-running operations

## Additional Implementation Strategies

Beyond configuration, here are coding techniques to improve memory usage:

```python
# 1. Selective caching - only persist necessary DataFrames
large_df = spark.read.parquet("s3://your-bucket/large-data/")
filtered_df = large_df.filter("important_column > 100").cache()  # Cache only filtered data
# Use filtered_df for multiple operations
filtered_df.unpersist()  # Release memory when done

# 2. Control partition sizes after filtering
if filtered_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() > 2000:  # Too many small partitions
    filtered_df = filtered_df.repartition(1000)
elif filtered_df.rdd.getNumPartitions() < 100:  # Too few large partitions
    filtered_df = filtered_df.repartition(1000)

# 3. Broadcast small DataFrames in joins
small_df = spark.read.parquet("s3://your-bucket/small-reference-data/")
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

result = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "join_key")


# 4. Process in batches for very large operations
def process_in_batches(df, batch_size=1000000):
    total = df.count()
    for offset in range(0, total, batch_size):
        batch = df.limit(batch_size).offset(offset)
        # Process batch
        batch.unpersist()  # Clean up
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

To diagnose memory issues:

1. Use the Spark UI (typically on port 4040) to monitor:
    - Storage tab: Check cached DataFrames and memory usage
    - Stages tab: Look for spill metrics and executor memory usage
    - SQL tab: Examine query plans for inefficient operations

2. Add strategic logging to track memory-intensive operations:
   ```python
   import time
   start = time.time()
   result = df.groupBy("key").agg({"value": "sum"})
   count = result.count()  # Force execution
   print(f"Operation completed with {count} results in {time.time() - start} seconds")
   ```

3. Consider checkpointing for deep lineage graphs:
   ```python
   spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir("s3://your-bucket/checkpoints/")
   complex_df.checkpoint()  # Materializes and saves intermediate results
   ```

## where is the OOMA error comminf eom Jupy kernel , master or task node

Great question! When running a Spark job from a Jupyter notebook on EMR, understanding how the components interact is
crucial for diagnosing memory issues. Let me clarify the architecture and how to determine where your OOM errors
originate:

## Jupyter Notebook and Spark Architecture on EMR

When you run Spark from a Jupyter notebook on EMR:

1. **The Jupyter notebook process runs on the master node** of your EMR cluster
2. **The Spark driver process also runs on the master node** (not in the Jupyter kernel itself)
3. **The notebook kernel (Python process) communicates with the Spark driver** via the PySpark API

This architecture means:

- Your notebook kernel → interacts with → Spark driver (master node) → coordinates → Spark executors (task nodes)

## Identifying OOM Source When Running from Jupyter

### 1. Jupyter Kernel OOM

If the **Jupyter notebook kernel** runs out of memory:

- Your notebook will become unresponsive or restart
- You'll see "Dead kernel" messages
- Python's memory error may appear in the notebook output
- The Spark job itself might continue running in the background

Signs of Jupyter kernel OOM:

- Memory issues occur after bringing large datasets into Python with `.toPandas()`, `.collect()`, etc.
- Kernel dies when plotting or manipulating large Python objects
- Memory usage increases as you run more cells without restarting

### 2. Spark Driver OOM (Master Node)

If the **Spark driver** runs out of memory:

- Your Spark session will terminate
- You'll need to recreate the SparkSession object
- Error messages will appear in notebook output mentioning "Java heap space"

Signs of driver OOM:

- Errors occur during `collect()`, `toPandas()`, large `show()` operations
- Error messages mention "GC overhead limit exceeded" or "Java heap space"
- Issues happen when joining or aggregating large datasets
- Messages about exceeding "maxResultSize"

### 3. Spark Executor OOM (Task Nodes)

If the **Spark executors** run out of memory:

- Individual tasks will fail
- Spark will retry them (possibly multiple times)
- The job may eventually fail completely

Signs of executor OOM:

- Errors about "task failed" or "executor lost"
- Error messages containing "Exit code 137" (OOM killer)
- Issues during shuffle operations or wide transformations
- Partial progress before failure

## How to Check Where OOM Is Occurring

### 1. Check Notebook Output for Specific Error Messages

```
# Driver OOM looks like:
"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"
"org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure"
"Results larger than spark.driver.maxResultSize"

# Executor OOM looks like:
"ExecutorLostFailure" with reason "Executor xxx exited with exit code 137"
"Failed to get shuffle block" messages
```

### 2. Check Spark UI from Jupyter

```python
# Get the Spark UI URL
print(spark.sparkContext.uiWebUrl)
```

- In EMR, you may need to set up SSH tunneling to access the Spark UI (typically on port 4040)
- The EMR console also provides access to the Spark UI through "Application user interfaces"

### 3. Add Diagnostic Code to Your Notebook

```python
# Monitor driver memory
def check_driver_memory():
    import subprocess
    result = subprocess.check_output(["ps", "-o", "rss,command", "-p",
                                      str(spark.sparkContext._jvm.java.lang.management.ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getPid())]).decode()
    print(f"Driver memory usage: {int(result.split()[1]) / 1024 / 1024:.2f} GB")


# Monitor notebook kernel memory
def check_kernel_memory():
    import psutil
    import os
    process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
    memory_info = process.memory_info()
    print(f"Jupyter kernel memory usage: {memory_info.rss / 1024 / 1024 / 1024:.2f} GB")


# Check both
check_kernel_memory()
check_driver_memory()
```

## Solution Approaches Based on OOM Location

### For Jupyter Kernel OOM:

```python
# Instead of bringing data to Python:
# BAD: full_data = large_df.toPandas()

# Process in Spark as much as possible
# GOOD: aggregated_data = large_df.groupBy("key").agg(...).toPandas()

# Or process in chunks
def process_in_chunks(spark_df, chunk_size=100000):
    count = spark_df.count()
    for start in range(0, count, chunk_size):
        chunk = spark_df.limit(chunk_size).offset(start).toPandas()
        # process chunk
        del chunk  # Free memory
```

### For Spark Driver OOM:

```python
# Increase driver memory in existing session
spark.conf.set("spark.driver.memory", "30g")

# Avoid collecting large results to driver
# Instead of: results = big_df.collect()
# Write to storage: big_df.write.parquet("s3://bucket/results/")

# Use sampling for exploration
sample_df = huge_df.sample(False, 0.01).cache()
```

### For Spark Executor OOM:

```python
# Increase executor memory and overhead
spark.conf.set("spark.executor.memory", "45g")
spark.conf.set("spark.executor.memoryOverhead", "15g")

# Increase partitioning for better distribution
big_df = big_df.repartition(2000)

# Break complex operations into steps with caching
step1 = df1.join(df2, "key").cache()
step1.count()  # Force materialization
result = step1.groupBy("col").agg(...)
step1.unpersist()  # Free memory
```
