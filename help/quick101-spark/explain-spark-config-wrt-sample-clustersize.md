# Configuration Analysis for Your Cluster (1 Master, 1 Core, 58 Task Nodes)

Let me analyze each configuration parameter in the context of your specific EMR cluster which has 1 master, 1 core, and
58 task nodes, likely using r5.16xlarge or similar instance types.

## Memory and Compute Resource Configurations

```python
.config("spark.driver.memory", "32g")
```

**Analysis**: Appropriate for your master node. Since you're comparing 200GB datasets, the driver needs sufficient
memory to coordinate the job and collect results.

```python
.config("spark.executor.memory", "48g")
```

**Analysis**: Well-sized for r5.16xlarge instances which have 512GB RAM. Allocating 48GB per executor allows for
approximately 10 executors per node, which is a good balance.

```python
.config("spark.executor.cores", 6)
```

**Analysis**: Good choice. With r5.16xlarge having 64 vCPUs, setting 6 cores per executor means about 10 executors per
node (with some overhead). This provides good parallelism while allowing enough memory per executor.

```python
.config("spark.executor.instances", 40)
```

**Analysis**: This is a static allocation setting. With 58 task nodes and approximately 10 executors per node possible,
you could potentially run up to 580 executors. Setting 40 is very conservative, which is why dynamic allocation is also
enabled.

## Dynamic Allocation Settings

```python
.config("spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled", "true")
.config("spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors", 20)
.config("spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors", 50)
```

**Analysis**:

- The dynamic allocation range (20-50) is **significantly underutilizing your cluster capacity**.
- With 58 task nodes capable of ~10 executors each, your max should be closer to 500.
- Recommended change: `.config("spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors", 500)`

## Memory Management

```python
.config("spark.executor.memoryOverhead", "10g")
```

**Analysis**: Good setting. When processing large datasets, having substantial overhead (about 20% of executor memory)
helps prevent container killing due to memory spikes.

```python
.config("spark.driver.maxResultSize", "16g")
```

**Analysis**: Reasonable for 200GB comparison jobs. This prevents the driver from crashing if large results are
collected.

```python
.config("spark.memory.fraction", 0.8)
.config("spark.memory.storageFraction", 0.3)
```

**Analysis**: Standard settings. 80% of executor memory for execution and storage, with 30% of that specifically
reserved for storage (cached data and broadcast variables).

## Parallelism Settings

```python
.config("spark.default.parallelism", 800)
.config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 800)
```

**Analysis**:

- With your cluster size (58 task nodes × ~60 cores = ~3,500 cores), 800 partitions is **too low**.
- You're creating only 0.23 tasks per core (800 ÷ 3,500).
- Recommended change: Increase to at least `.config("spark.default.parallelism", 3500)`
  and `.config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 3500)` or higher.

## Join Strategy Optimizations

```python
.config("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", "-1")
.config("spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin", "true")
```

**Analysis**: Excellent for large dataset comparisons. Disabling broadcast joins and preferring sort-merge joins will
prevent OOM errors when comparing 200GB datasets.

## Performance and Fault Tolerance

```python
.config("spark.speculation", "true")
```

**Analysis**: Good setting. Enables speculative execution to help with straggler tasks.

```python
.config("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
.config("spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled", "true")
```

**Analysis**: Excellent for large dataset comparisons which often have skewed data. Adaptive query execution adjusts
execution plans at runtime.

```python
.config("spark.network.timeout", "600s")
.config("spark.sql.broadcastTimeout", "1800s")
```

**Analysis**: Appropriate timeouts for large dataset operations. Prevents premature timeout failures during long
shuffles or broadcasts.

## Overall Assessment and Recommendations

The configuration is generally well-designed for memory-intensive operations, but significantly **underutilizes your
large cluster** in two key areas:

1. **Executor allocation**:
    - Current: Max 50 executors
    - Potential: ~500+ executors (58 nodes × 10 executors/node)
    - Recommendation: `.config("spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors", 500)`

2. **Parallelism**:
    - Current: 800 partitions
    - Recommended: At least 3,500 (1× total cores) or 7,000 (2× total cores)
    - Recommendation: `.config("spark.default.parallelism", 7000)` and `.config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 7000)`

With these adjustments, your configuration would make much better use of your substantial EMR cluster for comparing
200GB datasets.
