To read the partition size from a given DataFrame in PySpark

1. Basic method:
   ```python
   def get_partition_sizes(df):
       return df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda x: [sum(1 for _ in x)]).collect()
   ```

2. Usage:
   ```python
   # Assuming you have already read your DataFrame
   df = spark.read.parquet("path/to/your/data")
   
   partition_sizes = get_partition_sizes(df)
   print(f"Partition sizes: {partition_sizes}")
   print(f"Number of partitions: {len(partition_sizes)}")
   print(f"Total rows: {sum(partition_sizes)}")
   ```

3. Key points:
    - This method counts the number of rows in each partition
    - It returns a list where each element represents the size of a partition
    - The operation triggers a job, so it can be expensive for large datasets

4. Alternative for just partition count:
   ```python
   num_partitions = df.rdd.getNumPartitions()
   ```

5. Considerations:
    - Partition sizes may not be evenly distributed
    - Reading partition sizes requires processing the entire dataset

6. Performance note:
    - For very large datasets, consider using sampling techniques or Spark UI for partition information
