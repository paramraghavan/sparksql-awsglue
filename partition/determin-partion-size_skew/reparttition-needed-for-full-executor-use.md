To determine if you need to repartition your DataFrame for better utilization of executors and tasks, you'll want to
analyze the current partitioning and compare it to your cluster resources. Here's a concise approach:

1. Analyze current partitioning:
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
   
   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("PartitionAnalysis").getOrCreate()
   
   # Assuming df is your DataFrame
   num_partitions = df.rdd.getNumPartitions()
   partition_sizes = df.rdd.mapPartitions(lambda x: [sum(1 for _ in x)]).collect()
   
   print(f"Number of partitions: {num_partitions}")
   print(f"Partition sizes: {partition_sizes}")
   print(f"Total rows: {sum(partition_sizes)}")
   ```

2. Get cluster resources:
   ```python
   total_cores = spark.sparkContext.defaultParallelism
   print(f"Total available cores: {total_cores}")
   ```

3. Determine if repartitioning is needed:
    - If `num_partitions` is significantly less than `total_cores`, you're underutilizing resources
    - If partition sizes vary greatly, you may have skewed data distribution

4. Repartition if necessary:
   ```python
   if num_partitions < total_cores or max(partition_sizes) / min(partition_sizes) > 2:
       df_repartitioned = df.repartition(total_cores)
   ```

5. Consider these factors:
    - Data skew: If some partitions are much larger, use `df.repartition(col("skewed_column"))`
    - Memory constraints: Ensure partitions fit in executor memory
    - Nature of computations: Some operations benefit from fewer, larger partitions

6. Monitor with Spark UI:
    - Check the "Stages" tab to see task distribution and identify stragglers
