# What's skewed column
A skewed column in a dataset refers to a column where the distribution of values is significantly uneven or imbalanced. Here's a concise explanation of skewed columns:

1. Definition:
   - A column where some values appear much more frequently than others
   - The data distribution is not symmetric or uniform

2. Characteristics:
   - High concentration of data around certain values
   - Long tail in the distribution for less common values
   - Can be positively skewed (tail on right) or negatively skewed (tail on left)

3. Examples:
   - User IDs in a social media dataset where some users are much more active
   - Income data in a population, where a small percentage has very high incomes
   - Error codes in a log file, where some errors occur much more frequently

4. Impact on data processing:
   - Can lead to uneven distribution of data across partitions
   - May cause some executors to process significantly more data than others
   - Can result in performance bottlenecks and out-of-memory errors

5. Problems caused:
   - Inefficient use of cluster resources
   - Slower execution times for operations like joins and aggregations
   - Potential job failures due to memory issues on overloaded executors

6. Importance in big data:
   - More pronounced effect in distributed computing environments
   - Can significantly impact the performance of Spark jobs

7. Mitigation strategies:
   - Repartitioning based on the skewed column
   - Using salting techniques for join operations
   - Broadcast joins for small tables with skewed join keys

## Indentify skewed columns
To identify skewed columns in a PySpark DataFrame, you can use a combination of statistical methods and PySpark
functions. Here's a concise approach to detect skewed columns:

1. Basic statistics method:
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql.functions import col, count, countDistinct

   def identify_skewed_columns(df, threshold=0.8):
       total_rows = df.count()
       column_stats = []

       for column in df.columns:
           distinct_count = df.select(countDistinct(col(column))).collect()[0][0]
           max_count = df.groupBy(column).count().agg({"count": "max"}).collect()[0][0]
           
           skew_ratio = max_count / (total_rows / distinct_count)
           column_stats.append((column, skew_ratio))

       return [col for col, ratio in column_stats if ratio > threshold]

   skewed_columns = identify_skewed_columns(df)
   print("Skewed columns:", skewed_columns)
   ```

2. Using describe() for numerical columns:
   ```python
   numeric_cols = [f.name for f in df.schema.fields if isinstance(f.dataType, (IntegerType, LongType, FloatType, DoubleType))]
   stats = df.select(numeric_cols).describe().collect()
   
   for col in numeric_cols:
       mean = float(stats[1][col])
       stddev = float(stats[2][col])
       if stddev > 3 * mean:  # Using 3 standard deviations as a threshold
           print(f"Column {col} might be skewed")
   ```

3. Visualization method (requires conversion to Pandas):
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   def plot_column_distribution(df, column, max_categories=20):
       counts = df.groupBy(column).count().orderBy("count", ascending=False)
       pdf = counts.limit(max_categories).toPandas()
       
       plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
       plt.bar(pdf[column].astype(str), pdf['count'])
       plt.title(f"Distribution of {column}")
       plt.xlabel(column)
       plt.ylabel("Count")
       plt.xticks(rotation=45)
       plt.show()

   # Usage (be cautious with large datasets):
   plot_column_distribution(df, "potentially_skewed_column")
   ```

4. Considerations:
    - These methods can be computationally expensive for large datasets
    - The definition of "skew" can vary based on your specific use case
    - For very large datasets, consider using sampling techniques
