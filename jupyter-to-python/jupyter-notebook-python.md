# Steps to Convert Jupyter Notebook Spark Code to Python Code


## Built-in Jupyter Export
The simplest method is using Jupyter's built-in export feature:
1. Open your notebook in Jupyter
2. Go to File > Download as > Python (.py)
3. This creates a Python file that you can then clean up manually

## Command-line Tools

### jupyter nbconvert
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to python your_notebook.ipynb
```
This creates a Python file with all cells converted, including comments for markdown cells.

### nbconvert with additional options
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to python --no-prompt your_notebook.ipynb
```
The `--no-prompt` flag removes cell numbering, making the output cleaner.

## Specialized Tools

### Papermill
Papermill is useful if you need to parameterize and execute notebooks programmatically:
```bash
pip install papermill
```

### p2j and j2p
These tools convert between Python and Jupyter formats:
```bash
pip install p2j
pip install j2p
```

### jupytext
Jupytext maintains synchronization between notebooks and script versions:
```bash
pip install jupytext
jupytext --to py your_notebook.ipynb
```

## Post-Conversion Steps
After using any of these tools, you'll typically need to:

1. **Clean up the file**
   - Remove any Jupyter magic commands (lines starting with %)
   - Remove or convert any markdown cells (they'll appear as comments)
   - Remove any display/visualization code that's specific to notebooks
2. **Add proper imports**
   - Ensure all necessary imports are at the top of the file
   - Make sure SparkSession initialization is early in the script
3. **Add main function structure**
   - Wrap your code in a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block
   - Create proper functions for logical sections of code
4. **Handle SparkSession properly**
   - Initialize the SparkSession at the beginning
   - Add proper shutdown with `spark.stop()` at the end
5. **Add command-line arguments if needed**
   - Use `argparse` library to accept parameters
   - Replace hardcoded file paths with parameters
6. **Add logging**
   - Replace notebook print statements with proper logging
   - Add error handling with try/except blocks
7. **Test the script**
   - Run from command line: `python your_script.py`
   - Verify it produces the same results as the notebook
