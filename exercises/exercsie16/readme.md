A custom EMR cluster scaling configuration file that includes all the elements you mentioned. Here's a breakdown of the
key components:

### Core Configuration:

- Basic EMR cluster setup with Spark and Hadoop applications
- Standard master and core node configuration

### Custom Scaling Features:

1. **Number of servers to scale to**:
    - Each application has its own `MaxCapacity` and `MinCapacity` settings
    - For example, `data-processing-app` can scale from 2 to 20 nodes

2. **Task node mix (spot vs on-demand)**:
    - Each app defines its preferred instance mix
    - For example, `data-processing-app` uses 80% spot instances and 20% on-demand
    - `ml-training-app` uses a higher percentage of on-demand (40%) for more stability

3. **Instance count and type assignment by app**:
    - Each application has specific instance types allocated
    - For example, `data-processing-app` uses memory-optimized instances (r5 family)
    - `ml-training-app` uses GPU instances (p3 and g4dn families)

### Additional Features:

- Scaling triggers based on YARN memory availability and container pending ratio
- Timeout settings that switch to on-demand if spot instances aren't available
- Tagging for cost allocation

This configuration gives you a flexible setup that will automatically adjust resources based on the specific Spark
application (appName) that's running. You can easily modify the instance types, counts, and spot/on-demand ratios for
each application type.

## Losing Spot intances

**Spark job is still running** but the **Provisioned Spot Capacity is dropping rapidly (e.g., from 49 ‚Üí 22 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 0)
**, this likely indicates **Spot instance revocation or scaling down**, which can severely affect your job performance
or even cause failures. Here's a breakdown of what might be happening and how to address it:

---

## üîç What‚Äôs Likely Happening

### 1. **Spot Instance Interruptions**

* **AWS Spot Instances** can be revoked **at any time** when AWS needs capacity or if the market price exceeds your
  bid/threshold.
* When they are interrupted, your cluster **loses executors**, and this results in reduced capacity (which you‚Äôre
  seeing).

### 2. **Auto-Scaling Behavior**

* If your cluster is set to **auto-scale**, and Spark thinks it's underutilized (e.g., executors idle), the cluster may
  **scale down automatically**, even though tasks are still pending due to long stages or skew.

### 3. **YARN/MESOS/Standalone Resource Mismatch**

* If you're using YARN or another cluster manager, and there‚Äôs pressure on shared resources, Spark may be **preempted**
  or **starved** of resources temporarily.

### 4. **Misconfigured Timeout or Idle Executor Policy**

* If idle executors are set to time out quickly, they may be removed, even though the job will still need them later (
  e.g., in next stages).

---

## ‚úÖ What You Can Do to Fix or Mitigate It

### Immediate Checks:

1. **Check the Spark UI**:

    * Are tasks stuck in a stage or retrying?
    * Are there lost executors? (check ‚ÄúExecutors‚Äù tab)
    * Are stages pending with no available executors?

2. **Cloud Provider Console (e.g., AWS EMR, Databricks)**:

    * Look for messages like ‚ÄúSpot instance interruption‚Äù or ‚ÄúCapacity not available.‚Äù
    * Check if the **On-Demand fallback** is configured.

3. **Review Spark Logs**:

    * Search for messages like: `Lost executor`, `Container killed`, `Node lost`, `Executor decommissioned`.

---

### Mitigation Strategies:

#### üîÅ Fallback to On-Demand

If you are using only Spot instances:

* Enable **On-Demand fallback** in your cluster config.

    * **EMR**: Use `InstanceFleet` with `TargetOnDemandCapacity` as backup.
    * **Databricks**: Use a **Spot/On-Demand mix** and set ‚ÄúSpot fallbacks‚Äù in autoscaling settings.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Modify Spark Configs

In your job configuration, consider adjusting:

```bash
--conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true
--conf spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors=10
--conf spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout=300s
--conf spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout=1s
```

* Increase `executorIdleTimeout` to avoid quick executor termination.
* Tune `minExecutors` to prevent scale-down to 0.

#### üìâ Use Fewer or Smaller Spot Nodes

If losing big capacity chunks (e.g., 49 to 0), switch to **smaller instance types** (e.g., `m5.xlarge` instead
of `m5.4xlarge`) to reduce the blast radius of a revoked instance.

---

## üß† Recommendation

If you're on **EMR**, configure your cluster with an `InstanceFleet` or `InstanceGroup` with:

* **Spot Core nodes**, but include some **On-Demand or Reserved instances**.
* Enable **termination protection** if available.

If you're on **Databricks**, ensure:

* `Cluster autoscaling` is enabled with **On-Demand fallback**.
* You‚Äôre not hitting the **instance quota** or **region capacity limits**.

---

## Manage spot instance resizing

I can help you create a SparkSession builder configuration that will prevent your Spark cluster from continuously
resizing spot instances from 0 and back up. This configuration will help maintain your spot instances until your job
completes.

Here's a SparkSession builder configuration that addresses this issue:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a SparkSession with spot instance stability configurations
spark = SparkSession.builder
    .appName("StableSpotInstanceJob")
    .config("spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled", "false")
    .config("spark.executor.instances", "5")
    .config("spark.speculation", "false")
    .config("spark.task.maxFailures", "10")
    .config("spark.blacklist.enabled", "false")
    .config("spark.scheduler.mode", "FAIR")
    .config("spark.executor.extraJavaOptions", "-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp")
    .config("spark.executor.heartbeatInterval", "20s")
    .config("spark.network.timeout", "800s")
    .config("spark.storage.blockManagerSlaveTimeoutMs", "300000")
    .config("spark.executor.extraJavaOptions", "-Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp -Dio.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true")
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.multipart.size", "104857600")
    .getOrCreate()
```

Key configurations explained:

1. `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled = false` - Disables dynamic allocation which prevents Spark from automatically
   scaling up/down executors.

2. `spark.executor.instances = 5` - Sets a fixed number of executors (adjust this number based on your workload).

3. `spark.speculation = false` - Disables speculative execution which can cause duplicate tasks and unnecessary resource
   scaling.

4. `spark.task.maxFailures = 10` - Increases tolerance for task failures before giving up.

5. `spark.blacklist.enabled = false` - Prevents Spark from blacklisting nodes, which could lead to instances being
   terminated.

6. `spark.scheduler.mode = FAIR` - Uses fair scheduling to better distribute work.

7. `spark.executor.heartbeatInterval` and `spark.network.timeout` - Increases timeouts to handle temporary network
   issues without terminating executors.

If you're using AWS EMR specifically, you might also want to add these configurations to your EMR cluster properties:

```
{
  "classification": "spark-defaults",
  "properties": {
    "spark.scheduler.allocation.file": "/etc/spark/conf/fairscheduler.xml",
    "spark.scheduler.mode": "FAIR",
    "maximizeResourceAllocation": "true"
  }
}
```

Additionally, for the AWS EMR cluster configuration itself, consider setting:

- Disable "Scale down behavior" in the EMR configuration
- Set a consistent Availability Zone for all instances
- Use Instance Fleets with multiple instance types as fallbacks
