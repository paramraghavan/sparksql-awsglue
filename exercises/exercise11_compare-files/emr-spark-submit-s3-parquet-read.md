# Error when using s3a://bucket/test/file `ClassNotFoundException` error for S3AFileSystem. 
This means your EMR cluster is missing the required AWS Hadoop libraries to connect to S3 using the s3a protocol.

Few ways to resolve this issue:

## 1. Add AWS Hadoop libraries to your Spark job

When submitting your Spark job, you need to include the required AWS Hadoop libraries. You can do this by adding the
appropriate JAR files to your spark-submit command:

```bash
spark-submit \
  --packages org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.12.262 \
  your_script.py
```

The versions above should be compatible with Spark 3.5.5, but you might need to adjust them based on your exact EMR
configuration.

## 2. Configure Hadoop classpath with the AWS connector

Another approach is to ensure the AWS connector is in your Hadoop classpath. You can modify your script to:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder
    .appName("S3 File Comparison")
    .config("spark.sql.broadcastTimeout", "3600")
    .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.12.262")
    .getOrCreate()

# Then try using s3a protocol
path = "s3a://bucket1/test/pool/"
df = spark.read.parquet(path)
```

## 3. Use EMR's built-in EMRFS

Since you're on EMR, you can use the EMR File System (EMRFS) which is designed specifically for S3 access. Use the s3://
scheme with proper configuration:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder
    .appName("S3 File Comparison")
    .config("spark.sql.broadcastTimeout", "3600")
    .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3.impl", "com.amazon.ws.emr.hadoop.fs.EmrFileSystem")
    .getOrCreate()

path = "s3://bucket1/test/pool/"
df = spark.read.parquet(path)
```

## 4. Check EMR configuration

For EMR 7.7.0, these libraries should be pre-installed. You might need to check your EMR configuration to ensure the
proper components are installed. Verify that the Hadoop and Spark components are correctly installed with their AWS
extensions.
