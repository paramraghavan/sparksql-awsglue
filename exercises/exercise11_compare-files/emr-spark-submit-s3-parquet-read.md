# Error when using s3a://bucket/test/file `ClassNotFoundException` error for S3AFileSystem.

This means your EMR cluster is missing the required AWS Hadoop libraries to connect to S3 using the s3a protocol.

Few ways to resolve this issue:

## 1. Add AWS Hadoop libraries to your Spark job

When submitting your Spark job, you need to include the required AWS Hadoop libraries. You can do this by adding the
appropriate JAR files to your spark-submit command:

```bash
spark-submit \
  --packages org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.12.262 \
  your_script.py
```

The versions above should be compatible with Spark 3.5.5, but you might need to adjust them based on your exact EMR
configuration.

## 2. Configure Hadoop classpath with the AWS connector

Another approach is to ensure the AWS connector is in your Hadoop classpath. You can modify your script to:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder
.appName("S3 File Comparison")
.config("spark.sql.broadcastTimeout", "3600")
.config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
.config("spark.jars.packages", "org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.12.262")
.getOrCreate()

# Then try using s3a protocol
path = "s3a://bucket1/test/pool/"
df = spark.read.parquet(path)
```

## 3. Use EMR's built-in EMRFS

Since you're on EMR, you can use the EMR File System (EMRFS) which is designed specifically for S3 access. Use the s3://
scheme with proper configuration:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder
.appName("S3 File Comparison")
.config("spark.sql.broadcastTimeout", "3600")
.config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
.config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3.impl", "com.amazon.ws.emr.hadoop.fs.EmrFileSystem")
.getOrCreate()

path = "s3://bucket1/test/pool/"
df = spark.read.parquet(path)
```

## 4. Check EMR configuration

For EMR 7.7.0, these libraries should be pre-installed. You might need to check your EMR configuration to ensure the
proper components are installed. Verify that the Hadoop and Spark components are correctly installed with their AWS
extensions.

I'll help you fix the error with the EmrFileSystem as well. Let me provide a more comprehensive solution that should
work with your EMR 7.7.0 cluster.

## Use the correct EMRFS implementation

The error indicates that the class name I provided earlier was incorrect. The correct implementation class for EMRFS in
modern EMR versions is:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("S3 File Comparison") \
    .config("spark.sql.broadcastTimeout", "3600") \
    .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200") \
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3.impl", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3.S3FileSystem") \
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

## Fix with AWS JAR dependencies

Let me search for the most up-to-date solution for EMR 7.7.0 and Spark 3.5.5.

Based on my research, I can provide a solution for your S3 access issue in EMR 7.7.0 with Spark 3.5.5.

## Solution: Use EMRFS with proper configuration

For Amazon EMR, the recommended approach is to use the EMR File System (EMRFS) which is specifically designed for S3
access. EMRFS allows you to directly access data in Amazon S3 and is the preferred method over S3A.

Try this configuration:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder
    .appName("S3 File Comparison")
    .config("spark.sql.broadcastTimeout", "3600")
    .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3.impl", "com.amazon.ws.emr.hadoop.fs.EmrFileSystem")
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3.enableServerSideEncryption", "true")
    .getOrCreate()

# Use s3:// protocol instead of s3a://
path = "s3://bucket1/test/pool/"
df = spark.read.parquet(path)
```

If you're still encountering issues with the class not found, you'll need to add the required JAR files to your Spark
job.

## Alternative: Add AWS JAR dependencies to Spark

If the class not found error persists, you need to add the path of your custom JAR that contains the missing class to
the Spark class path. You can do this in two ways:

### 1. Via spark-submit command:

```bash
spark-submit \
  --packages org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.12.262 \
  your_script.py
```

### 2. Via SparkSession configuration:

```python
spark = SparkSession.builder
    .appName("S3 File Comparison")
    .config("spark.sql.broadcastTimeout", "3600")
    .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.12.262")
    .getOrCreate()

# Try with s3a:// protocol now that we've added the necessary jars
path = "s3a://bucket1/test/pool/"
df = spark.read.parquet(path)
```

## Important Note About S3 Protocol Usage

For EMR, the recommended S3 client is EMRFS. You can use either s3a (Apache Hadoop) or s3/s3n (EMRFS), but the latter
has advantages like consistent view.

For EMR 7.7.0, using the "s3://" protocol with EMRFS is generally the most reliable approach, as it's specifically
optimized for AWS.
