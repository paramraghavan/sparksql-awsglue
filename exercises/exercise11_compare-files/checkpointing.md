Adding `spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir("/tmp/spark-checkpoint")` would be an excellent addition to the script. Let
me explain why checkpointing is important for this particular workload and how it would benefit your Parquet comparison
job:

### Why Use Checkpointing in This Script

1. **Breaking Long Lineage Chains**

   When comparing two large Parquet datasets with 3.5 million rows and 450 columns, Spark builds complex DAGs (Directed
   Acyclic Graphs) with deep lineage chains. This happens especially during:

    - Multiple joins between source and target datasets
    - Column-by-column comparisons
    - Aggregation operations to count differences

   Without checkpointing, Spark must recompute or shuffle data repeatedly when a node fails or when memory pressure
   occurs, potentially causing job failures.

2. **Preventing Stack Overflow Errors**

   For complex operations with many transformations (like our column-wise comparison loop), the lineage can become so
   deep that it causes stack overflow exceptions during task scheduling or execution. Checkpointing truncates this
   lineage by materializing intermediate results.

3. **Memory Management for Wide Transformations**

   The comparison process involves several wide transformations (joins, aggregations) that can create memory pressure.
   Checkpointing forces materialization of intermediate results, freeing up memory by allowing earlier RDDs to be
   garbage collected.

4. **Recovery From Node Failures**

   EMR clusters can experience node failures, especially during resource-intensive operations. Checkpointing creates
   recovery points so that if a node fails, the entire job doesn't need to restart from the beginning.

### Implementation in the Code

I would add checkpointing in these specific locations:

```python
def create_spark_session(args):
    """Create and configure Spark session based on args"""
    spark = (
        SparkSession.builder
        # ... existing configurations ...
        .getOrCreate()
    )

    # Set checkpoint directory - use HDFS path for EMR
    spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir("hdfs:///tmp/spark-checkpoint")
    return spark


# Then in the comparison function:
def compare_data(spark, source_df, target_df, key_columns, exclude_columns):
    # ... existing code ...

    # After getting common keys
    common_keys = source_keys.join(target_keys, key_columns, "inner")
    common_keys_count = common_keys.count()

    # Checkpoint the common keys to truncate lineage
    common_keys = common_keys.checkpoint()

    # ... rest of function ...

    # Inside the column comparison loop after every few columns (e.g., every 50)
    for i, column in enumerate(common_columns):
        # ... column comparison code ...

        if i > 0 and i % 50 == 0:
            # Checkpoint intermediate results periodically
            joined = joined.checkpoint()
```

### Important Considerations for EMR

1. **Use HDFS Instead of Local Path**

   For EMR clusters, use an HDFS path like `hdfs:///tmp/spark-checkpoint` instead of a local filesystem path. This
   ensures all nodes can access the checkpoint data.

2. **Storage Requirements**

   Checkpointing materializes data to disk, requiring sufficient HDFS storage. With your dataset size (3.5M rows Ã— 450
   columns), ensure your EMR cluster has adequate HDFS capacity.

3. **Performance Trade-off**

   Checkpointing adds I/O overhead as data is written to and read from disk. However, for complex operations like your
   table comparison, this overhead is typically outweighed by the benefits of lineage truncation and improved stability.

4. **Alternative: RDD Persist**

   In some cases, you might consider using `persist()` with `MEMORY_AND_DISK` storage level instead of full
   checkpointing, which gives similar benefits with less I/O overhead:

   ```python
   from pyspark.storagelevel import StorageLevel
   
   # Instead of checkpoint()
   joined = joined.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)
   ```

Adding checkpointing is virtually essential for this script given the complexity of operations on such large datasets.
It significantly improves stability and prevents common failure patterns in Spark jobs, especially on EMR clusters.

## checkpoint cleaner


### What `spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints` Does

This configuration controls whether Spark should automatically clean up checkpoint files when they're no longer needed:

- When set to `true` (default): Spark automatically deletes checkpoint files once the RDDs that depend on them are no
  longer used
- When set to `false`: Checkpoint files are preserved even after their associated RDDs are garbage collected

### When to Use It in Your Script

For your Parquet comparison job with 3.5 million rows and 450 columns, here's when to consider each setting:

#### Set to `true` (Default) When:

1. **Limited HDFS Space**: Your EMR cluster has limited HDFS capacity and you need to conserve storage

2. **Single-Run Jobs**: The comparison is a one-time operation and you don't need to reuse intermediate results

3. **Memory-Intensive Processing**: Your job is creating many checkpoints during the column-by-column comparison, and
   you want to ensure old checkpoints are cleaned up to save space

4. **Long-Running Job**: The comparison runs for several hours, creating many checkpoints that would otherwise
   accumulate

#### Set to `false` When:

1. **Debugging Complex Jobs**: You're troubleshooting the comparison script and want to examine checkpoint data

2. **Multi-Stage Processing**: Your workflow involves multiple Spark applications that might reuse checkpoint data

3. **External Process Dependency**: You have external processes that might read the checkpointed data

4. **Failure Analysis**: You're experiencing job failures and want to preserve checkpoints for post-mortem analysis

### Implementation in Your Code

To explicitly configure this in your script, add it to your SparkSession configuration:

```python
def create_spark_session(args):
    """Create and configure Spark session based on args"""
    spark = (
        SparkSession.builder
        .appName("Large Parquet Comparison")
        # ... existing configurations ...
        .config("spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints", "true")  # Automatic cleanup
        .getOrCreate()
    )

    # Set checkpoint directory
    spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir("hdfs:///tmp/spark-checkpoint")
    return spark
```

### Best Practices for Your Use Case

For your specific parquet comparison task, I recommend:

1. **Start with Default (`true`)**: Begin with automatic cleanup enabled to prevent HDFS from filling up

2. **Hybrid Approach**: For critical intermediate results that are expensive to recompute (like after joining the two
   3.5M-row tables), consider using a separate checkpoint directory with explicit management:

   ```python
   # In your main function
   critical_checkpoint_dir = f"hdfs:///tmp/spark-checkpoint-critical-{int(time.time())}"
   spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir("hdfs:///tmp/spark-checkpoint")
   
   # Later, for critical data
   original_checkpoint_dir = spark.sparkContext.getCheckpointDir()
   spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir(critical_checkpoint_dir)
   critical_data = joined_df.checkpoint()
   spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir(original_checkpoint_dir)
   
   # At the end of your script, add cleanup logic if needed
   if args.clean_checkpoints:
       subprocess.run(["hdfs", "dfs", "-rm", "-r", critical_checkpoint_dir])
   ```

3. **Performance Monitoring**: If you observe that checkpoint I/O is becoming a bottleneck, consider using `persist()`
   with `StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK` for less critical operations and only use full checkpointing for the most complex
   stages

4. **Explicit Cleanup for Long Jobs**: For comparisons that process all 450 columns and run for many hours, consider
   adding explicit cleanup calls periodically:

   ```python
   # After processing a batch of columns
   if i > 0 and i % 100 == 0:
       spark.sparkContext.cleaner.cleanup()
   ```

The best setting depends on your specific EMR cluster configuration, the amount of HDFS space available, and how
critical job reliability is versus storage efficiency. For production jobs processing your full 3.5M rows, enabling
automatic cleanup is generally the safer option to prevent your job from failing due to disk space issues.
