Certainly! I'll guide you through the process of running and debugging PySpark code in PyCharm. This process involves
setting up your project correctly, configuring PyCharm, and using its debugging features.

1. Set up your PyCharm project:

   a. Open PyCharm and create a new project or open your existing PySpark project.
   b. Ensure that your project structure includes your PySpark script, configuration files, and any data files you're
   using.

2. Configure Python Interpreter:

   a. Go to File > Settings (on Windows/Linux) or PyCharm > Preferences (on macOS).
   b. Navigate to Project: YourProjectName > Python Interpreter.
   c. Click the gear icon next to the interpreter dropdown and select "Add".
   d. Choose "System Interpreter" and select the Python executable where PySpark is installed.
   e. Click "OK" to create the new interpreter.

3. Set up Run/Debug Configuration:

   a. Go to Run > Edit Configurations.
   b. Click the "+" button and select "Python".
   c. Name your configuration (e.g., "PySpark Debug").
   d. Set the script path to your main PySpark script.
   e. In the "Environment variables" section, add:
      ```
      PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS=--master local[*] pyspark-shell
      SPARK_HOME=/path/to/your/spark
      PYTHONPATH=$SPARK_HOME/python:$SPARK_HOME/python/lib/py4j-<version>-src.zip:$PYTHONPATH
      ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/spark` with your actual Spark installation path.
   f. Set the working directory to your project root.

4. Modify your PySpark code for debugging:

   Add print statements or logging to help track the execution flow. Here's an example:

```python
import os
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import from_json, explode, col
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, DoubleType, IntegerType, ArrayType
import json
import yaml


def create_schema(field_config):
    print(f"Creating schema for: {field_config}")
    # ... (rest of the function)


def parse_json(spark, json_data, config):
    print("Starting JSON parsing")
    # ... (rest of the function)


def main():
    print("Starting PySpark application...")

    # Initialize Spark session
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ConfigDrivenJsonParser").getOrCreate()
    print(f"Spark session created: {spark.sparkContext.appName}")

    # Get current working directory
    current_dir = os.getcwd()
    print(f"Current working directory: {current_dir}")

    # Load configuration from YAML file
    config_path = os.path.join(current_dir, 'config.yaml')
    print(f"Loading configuration from: {config_path}")
    with open(config_path, 'r') as config_file:
        config = yaml.safe_load(config_file)
    print("Configuration loaded successfully")

    # Load sample JSON data
    data_path = os.path.join(current_dir, 'sample_data.json')
    print(f"Loading sample data from: {data_path}")
    with open(data_path, 'r') as data_file:
        json_data = json.load(data_file)
    print("Sample data loaded successfully")

    # Parse the JSON data
    print("Parsing JSON data...")
    result_df = parse_json(spark, json_data, config)

    # Show the result
    print("Showing parsed data:")
    result_df.show(truncate=False)

    # Stop the Spark session
    print("Stopping Spark session...")
    spark.stop()
    print("PySpark application completed.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

5. Set Breakpoints:

   In PyCharm, click in the left margin next to the line numbers where you want the debugger to pause. A red dot will
   appear, indicating a breakpoint.

6. Start Debugging:

   a. Select your PySpark debug configuration from the dropdown menu in the top-right corner of PyCharm.
   b. Click the bug icon or press Shift+F9 to start debugging.

7. Use Debugging Tools:

   Once the debugger hits a breakpoint, you can:
    - Step through the code line by line (F8)
    - Step into functions (F7)
    - Step out of functions (Shift+F8)
    - Resume program execution (F9)
    - Evaluate expressions (Alt+F8)
    - View variable values in the "Variables" pane

8. Inspect Spark DataFrames:

   When debugging Spark operations, you can use the following in the debug console:
    - `df.show()` to display the contents of a DataFrame
    - `df.printSchema()` to show the schema of a DataFrame
    - `df.count()` to get the number of rows

9. Monitor Spark Jobs:

   While debugging, you can open the Spark UI (usually at `http://localhost:4040`) in a web browser to monitor job
   progress and resource usage.

10. Troubleshooting:

    If you encounter issues:
    - Ensure all paths in your environment variables are correct
    - Check that PySpark is properly installed and accessible from your Python interpreter
    - Verify that your Spark installation is compatible with your Python version

11. Performance Considerations:

    - When debugging, consider using a small subset of your data to improve performance
    - If the debugger is slow, you might need to increase PyCharm's memory allocation in Help > Change Memory Settings

Remember, debugging distributed Spark jobs can be complex. The local mode setup described here is often sufficient for
debugging logic, but some issues may only appear in a true distributed environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively run and debug your PySpark code in PyCharm. If you encounter
any specific errors or issues during this process, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot
further.
