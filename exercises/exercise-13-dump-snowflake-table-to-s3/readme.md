# Key Considerations for Your Approach

1. **For Python-based export (first script):**
    - Uses batching to handle the large 25-30GB table size
    - Requires Snowflake Python connector and AWS SDK
    - Works with environment variables for credentials
    - Supports multiple output formats (parquet, CSV, pipe-delimited)

2. **For Snowflake COPY command (second script):**
    - More efficient for large data transfers
    - Requires Snowflake admin privileges to set up integration
    - Handles the file splitting automatically
    - Requires less code but more Snowflake configuration

3. **For PySpark processing (third script):**
    - Configures Spark to use your AWS profile
    - Handles all formats (parquet, CSV, pipe-delimited)
    - Includes example transformations you can customize

## explain CREATE OR REPLACE STORAGE INTEGRATION

The `CREATE OR REPLACE STORAGE INTEGRATION` command is a crucial part of setting up secure access between Snowflake and
external cloud storage services like AWS S3. Let me break down this command:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE STORAGE INTEGRATION s3_integration
  TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
  STORAGE_PROVIDER = S3
  ENABLED = TRUE
  STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/your-snowflake-role'
  STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://your-s3-bucket-name/your/prefix/path/');
```

Here's what each part does:

1. **CREATE OR REPLACE STORAGE INTEGRATION s3_integration**: This creates a new integration object named "
   s3_integration" (or replaces an existing one with the same name). This object serves as a named, reusable
   configuration for connecting to external storage.

2. **TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE**: Specifies that this integration will be used for external stages. This is the type used
   for data loading/unloading operations.

3. **STORAGE_PROVIDER = S3**: Indicates that the external storage is Amazon S3. Snowflake also supports Azure and Google
   Cloud Storage.

4. **ENABLED = TRUE**: Activates the integration.

5. **STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN**: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Snowflake will assume when
   accessing S3. This role must:
    - Exist in your AWS account
    - Have permissions to access the specified S3 bucket
    - Have a trust relationship configured to allow Snowflake to assume it

6. **STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS**: Defines which S3 locations Snowflake is allowed to access using this integration. This
   is a security feature that limits the scope of access.

Important notes about this command:

- It requires ACCOUNTADMIN privileges or the CREATE INTEGRATION privilege to execute.
- After creating the integration, you need to run `DESC INTEGRATION s3_integration` to get the external ID that must be
  added to the trust relationship policy in your AWS IAM role.
- This is a one-time setup at the account level, and then the integration can be used by multiple stages and users
  within Snowflake (if they have appropriate permissions).
- The integration creates a secure, credential-less connection between Snowflake and S3 - meaning you don't need to
  provide AWS access keys in your Snowflake scripts.

This approach is considerably more secure than using AWS access keys directly, as it leverages AWS IAM roles and follows
the principle of least privilege.

For your 25-30GB table, the Snowflake COPY approach will likely be faster if you have the necessary permissions. If not,
the Python batching approach gives you more control but may take longer.
