**Problem**
Running pyspark get UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte Oxff in position

**Restarting the kernel error goes away, otherwise the clsuter keeps spitting error:**

That behavior makes sense and gives us a good clue about what's happening. 
When you restart the Jupyter kernel:

1. **The Spark context is terminated and reinitialized**: This cleans up any lingering connections, cached data, and
   internal state.

2. **Memory is cleared**: Any corrupted data or objects that were causing issues are removed.

3. **Socket connections are reset**: The error mentions socketserver.py, indicating the issue may involve network
   communication between Spark components.

This suggests the error is likely related to one of these scenarios:

1. **Accumulated state problem**: After processing some data with invalid UTF-8 characters, Spark's internal state
   becomes corrupted. The accumulator mechanism (even if you're not explicitly using it) tries to handle this corrupted
   state, leading to the error.

2. **Connection instability**: The communication channel between the Spark driver and executors becomes unstable after
   encountering the encoding issue.

3. **Memory corruption**: The invalid binary data might be causing memory corruption that doesn't get properly cleaned
   up until a full restart.

To prevent needing to restart the kernel, you could try:

```python
# At the beginning of your notebook
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Stop any existing session
spark.stop()

# Create a new session with specific configurations
spark = SparkSession.builder
    .appName("My App")
    .config("spark.driver.memory", "4g")
    .config("spark.executor.memory", "4g")
    .config("spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled", "true")
    .config("spark.sql.execution.arrow.fallback.enabled", "true")
    .getOrCreate()

# Process data with stricter data type handling
schema = ...  # Define proper schema with appropriate types
df = spark.read.schema(schema)...
```

For ongoing development in Jupyter notebooks with Spark, consider these practices:

1. Use cell magic `%%capture` for cells that might produce errors, to prevent console flooding
2. Add explicit error handling around problematic operations
3. Consider adding a "reset" cell that you can run instead of restarting the kernel:

```python
def reset_spark():
    # Stop current context
    spark.stop()
    # Create new one
    global spark
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("My App").getOrCreate()
    print("Spark context reset successfully")


# Run this instead of restarting kernel
reset_spark()
```

These approaches will help you maintain a more stable development environment without constantly restarting the kernel.
