# How to fix pyspark stack overflow because of recursive operation on dataframe
- In my case getting java.lang.StackOverflow on internal executor  

```python
def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for _ in range(iterations):
        result_df = result_df.transform(...)
    return result_df
```

The stack overflow  is likely due to the lineage building up with each iteration. 
Here's some ways to fix it:

1. Break the Lineage with Cache/Checkpoint

```python
def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for i in range(iterations):
        result_df = result_df.transform(your_transformation)
        # Break lineage every N iterations
        if i % 5 == 0:  # Adjust number based on your memory constraints
            result_df = result_df.cache()
            result_df.count()  # Force materialization
    return result_df
```

2. Use Checkpointing for More Complex Cases

```python
# First set checkpoint directory
spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir('s3://your-bucket/checkpoint')


# or local
# spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir('/tmp/checkpoint')

def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for i in range(iterations):
        result_df = result_df.transform(your_transformation)
        if i % 5 == 0:
            # Checkpoint breaks the lineage completely
            result_df = result_df.checkpoint()
    return result_df
```

3. Persist with Specific Storage Level

```python
from pyspark.storagelevel import StorageLevel


def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for i in range(iterations):
        result_df = result_df.transform(your_transformation)
        if i % 5 == 0:
            result_df = result_df.persist(StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)
            result_df.count()
    return result_df
```

4. Persist with Specific Storage Level and Checkpoint
```python
from pyspark.storagelevel import StorageLevel


def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for i in range(iterations):
        result_df = result_df.transform(your_transformation)
    # Checkpoint every 5 iterations instead of 2
    if n % 5 == 0 and n > 0:
        print(f'Applying checkpoint at iteration {n}')
        # Clean up previous checkpoint
        spark.sparkContext.cleanFiles()
        # Use persist() with memory and disk
        result_df = result_df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)
        # Force materialization
        result_df.count()
    return result_df

5. Most Memory-Efficient Version

```python
def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for i in range(iterations):
        # Unpersist previous version to free memory
        if i > 0:
            result_df.unpersist()

        result_df = result_df.transform(your_transformation)

        # Cache and materialize every iteration
        result_df = result_df.cache()
        result_df.count()

    return result_df
```

6. If the above doesn't help, you can try increasing the Java stack size:
```python
# Configure this before creating SparkSession
spark_conf = SparkConf()
spark_conf.set("spark.driver.extraJavaOptions", "-Xss4m")
spark_conf.set("spark.executor.extraJavaOptions", "-Xss4m")
```

7. You can also try using persist() instead of checkpoint():
```python
from pyspark.storagelevel import StorageLevel

 for i in range(iterations):
    # Your existing query code...
    
    if n % 5 == 0 and n > 0:
        # Use persist instead of checkpoint
        result_df = result_df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)
        # Force materialization
        result_df.count()
        # Optionally unpersist old data
        if n > 5:
            result_df.unpersist()
``` 

8. If the issue persists, you might need to adjust your Spark memory configurations:
```python
spark_conf = SparkConf()
spark_conf.set("spark.memory.fraction", "0.8")  # Increase memory fraction for execution
spark_conf.set("spark.memory.storageFraction", "0.3")  # Adjust storage fraction
spark_conf.set("spark.executor.memory", "8g")  # Increase executor memory
spark_conf.set("spark.driver.memory", "4g")  # Increase driver memory
```

9. If still having issues, implement the repartitioning strategy
```python
for loop:
    # Repartition periodically to avoid data skew
    if n % 5 == 0 and n > 0:
        result_df = result_df.repartition(spark.sparkContext.defaultParallelism)
        result_df.cache()
        result_df.count()  # Force mater
```

**_Key points to remember:_**

- Cache/persist breaks the lineage partially
- Checkpoint breaks the lineage completely but is slower
- If that doesn't work, add the Java stack size configuration
- If still having issues, implement the repartitioning strategy
- Adjust the frequency of caching based on your memory constraints
- Always materialize cached DataFrames with an action like count()
- Consider unpersisting previous versions to free memory

## Is this normal
Yes, this is a relatively common issue in Spark, especially when dealing with iterative operations.

1. Root Cause:
```python
# In your code, each iteration adds more transformations to Spark's DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):
for n in range(...):
    query_string2 = ...
    df_pred_temp = spark.sql(query_string2)
    df_temp = df_temp.join(...)  # Each join adds to the transformation chain
```

The StackOverflow happens because:
- Each iteration adds more transformations to Spark's logical execution plan
- The joins create deeper and deeper nested operations
- Spark has to maintain this entire chain of transformations in memory
- When the chain gets too long, Java runs out of stack space for managing these nested calls

2. Why Checkpointing Helps:
```python
df_temp = df_temp.checkpoint()  # This materializes the data
```
Checkpointing breaks the chain of transformations by:
- Actually executing all previous transformations
- Saving the result
- Starting a new DAG from that point

3. Common Scenarios Where This Occurs:
- Iterative algorithms
- Multiple joins in loops
- Machine learning pipelines with many transformations
- Complex data processing with nested operations

Think of it like building a tower of blocks:
- Without checkpointing: You keep adding blocks (transformations) until the tower becomes too tall and falls
- With checkpointing: You periodically create a new solid foundation and start building from there

To prevent this:
```python
# Option 1: Regular materialization
if n % 5 == 0:
    df_temp.cache().count()  # Forces computation and caches result

# Option 2: Periodic cleanup
if n % 5 == 0:
    spark.sparkContext.clearFiles()  # Cleans up old checkpoints
    df_temp = df_temp.checkpoint()
```

It's normal in the sense that it's a known limitation when working with very deep transformation chains in Spark, 
but it's also something that can and should be managed through proper checkpointing, caching, or materialization strategies.
