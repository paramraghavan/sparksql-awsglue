# How to fix pyspark stack overflow because of recursive operation on dataframe

```python
def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for _ in range(iterations):
        result_df = result_df.transform(...)
    return result_df
```

The stack overflow  is likely due to the lineage building up with each iteration. 
Here's some ways to fix it:

1. Break the Lineage with Cache/Checkpoint

```python
def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for i in range(iterations):
        result_df = result_df.transform(your_transformation)
        # Break lineage every N iterations
        if i % 5 == 0:  # Adjust number based on your memory constraints
            result_df = result_df.cache()
            result_df.count()  # Force materialization
    return result_df
```

2. Use Checkpointing for More Complex Cases

```python
# First set checkpoint directory
spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir('s3://your-bucket/checkpoint')


# or local
# spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir('/tmp/checkpoint')

def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for i in range(iterations):
        result_df = result_df.transform(your_transformation)
        if i % 5 == 0:
            # Checkpoint breaks the lineage completely
            result_df = result_df.checkpoint()
    return result_df
```

3. Persist with Specific Storage Level

```python
from pyspark.storagelevel import StorageLevel


def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for i in range(iterations):
        result_df = result_df.transform(your_transformation)
        if i % 5 == 0:
            result_df = result_df.persist(StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)
            result_df.count()
    return result_df
```

4. Most Memory-Efficient Version

```python
def iterative_transform(df, iterations):
    result_df = df
    for i in range(iterations):
        # Unpersist previous version to free memory
        if i > 0:
            result_df.unpersist()

        result_df = result_df.transform(your_transformation)

        # Cache and materialize every iteration
        result_df = result_df.cache()
        result_df.count()

    return result_df
```

**_Key points to remember:_**

- Cache/persist breaks the lineage partially
- Checkpoint breaks the lineage completely but is slower
- Adjust the frequency of caching based on your memory constraints
- Always materialize cached DataFrames with an action like count()
- Consider unpersisting previous versions to free memory
