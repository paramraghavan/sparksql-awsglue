he main performance bottleneck is actually in the drop() operation itself, which requires PySpark to:

Analyze the DataFrame's schema
Create a new DataFrame with the filtered columns
Potentially shuffle data across the cluster

What makes dropping columns slow in PySpark is that it's a transformation that creates an entirely new DataFrame rather
than modifying the existing one in place. When you have a very large DataFrame with many columns, this can be
resource-intensive.
That's why the select() approach is often faster - it lets you specify exactly which columns to keep in one operation,
avoiding the need to first enumerate all columns and then subtract the ones you want to drop.

```python
# Method 1: Use select() with all columns you want to KEEP (often faster than drop)
columns_to_keep = [col for col in df.columns if '_raw' not in col and 'num_conds_rule' not in col]
df_filtered = df.select(columns_to_keep)

# Method 2: If you prefer drop, create the list just once
columns_to_drop = [col for col in df.columns if '_raw' in col or 'num_conds_rule' in col]
df_filtered = df.drop(*columns_to_drop)

# Method 3: Use DataFrame.cache() if you're performing multiple operations
df.cache()  # Cache the DataFrame in memory
df_filtered = df.drop(*[col for col in df.columns if '_raw' in col or 'num_conds_rule' in col])
```

If your DataFrame has a very large number of columns, using `select()` with columns you want to keep (Method 1) is often
more efficient than dropping columns.

## large number of columns
That explains it! When dealing with a DataFrame that has a large number of columns, here are the most effective approaches:

1. **Prefer `select()` over `drop()`**: This is usually the most efficient method when you have many columns:

```python
# Get columns to keep
columns_to_keep = [col for col in df.columns if '_raw' not in col and 'num_conds_rule' not in col]
df_filtered = df.select(columns_to_keep)
```

2. **Use column name patterns with `regex`**: If you have a structured naming pattern, you can avoid iterating through all columns:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import regexp_extract, col

# Select columns that DON'T match the patterns
df_filtered = df.select([col for col in df.columns 
                         if not col.endswith('_raw') and 'num_conds_rule' not in col])
```

3. **Repartition before filtering**: If your DataFrame is very large, proper partitioning can help:

```python
# Repartition if needed before the expensive column operation
df_repartitioned = df.repartition(n)  # n is the number of partitions
df_filtered = df_repartitioned.select(columns_to_keep)
```

4. **Use Spark SQL if applicable**:

```python
df.createOrReplaceTempView("my_table")
df_filtered = spark.sql("""
SELECT * EXCEPT 
  (SELECT col_name FROM my_table LATERAL VIEW explode(array(${colNames})) t AS col_name 
   WHERE col_name LIKE '%_raw%' OR col_name LIKE '%num_conds_rule%')
FROM my_table
""")
```

5. **If this is a repeated operation**, consider creating a more efficient schema from the beginning to avoid frequent column filtering.

Among these options, the `select()` approach (option #1) is usually the most straightforward and efficient for your specific use case with many columns.
