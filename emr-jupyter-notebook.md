# have emr with jupyterenterprisegateway 2.6.0 installed, how do i connect this emr with jupyter notebook

To connect your EMR (Elastic MapReduce) cluster with Jupyter Notebook using JupyterEnterpriseGateway 2.6.0, you'll need
to follow these steps:

1. First, ensure your EMR cluster is properly configured with JupyterEnterpriseGateway 2.6.0 installed.

2. You have two main options to connect:

## Option 1: Using the Kernel Gateway Client

You can connect to your EMR cluster from your local Jupyter Notebook using the `jupyter_kernel_gateway` client:

```python
# Install the client if you haven't already
# pip install jupyter_kernel_gateway

# In your notebook or jupyter_notebook_config.py
c.KernelGatewayClient.url = "http://emr-master-node-dns:8888"  # Replace with your EMR master node DNS and port
```

## Option 2: Setting up a direct connection

1. SSH into your EMR master node or create an SSH tunnel:
   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem -L 8888:localhost:8888 hadoop@emr-master-node-dns
   ```

2. Configure your Jupyter Notebook to use the Enterprise Gateway as its kernel provider:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook --gateway-url=http://localhost:8888
   ```

## Option 3: Using AWS Console integration

If you're using AWS EMR's Jupyter integration:

1. Go to your EMR cluster in the AWS console
2. Click on "Applications" tab
3. Find JupyterEnterpriseGateway in the list and click on "Connect"
4. Follow the prompts to create an SSH tunnel and connect

For more specific configuration, you might need to modify the JupyterEnterpriseGateway configuration files on your EMR
cluster located in `/etc/jupyter/jupyter_enterprise_gateway_config.py`.

## how do i connect from my pcs chrome browser
To connect to your EMR cluster's JupyterEnterpriseGateway 2.6.0 from your PC's Chrome browser, you'll need to set up an SSH tunnel and then access Jupyter through your browser. Here's how to do it:

## Setup SSH Tunnel

1. **Set up an SSH tunnel from your PC to the EMR master node**:

   **For Windows users**:
   - Install PuTTY or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
   - In PuTTY, set:
     - Host Name: `hadoop@emr-master-node-dns` (replace with your actual EMR master node address)
     - Under Connection > SSH > Tunnels:
       - Source port: `8888`
       - Destination: `localhost:8888`
       - Click "Add" then "Open"
     - Enter your key when prompted

   **For Mac/Linux users**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem -L 8888:localhost:8888 hadoop@emr-master-node-dns
   ```
   (Replace `your-key.pem` with your actual key file and `emr-master-node-dns` with your EMR master node address)

2. **Keep this SSH session open** while you're using Jupyter

## Access Jupyter in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8888
   ```

2. You might be prompted for a token or password. If you don't know it:
   - In your SSH session, run:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook list
     ```
   - This will show running notebooks with their tokens
   - Copy the token from the output (it looks like `?token=abc123xyz...`)

3. If you're using JupyterHub with the Enterprise Gateway, you may need to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8888/hub/login
   ```

## Alternative: Using AWS EMR Studio

If your organization has set up EMR Studio (which provides a managed Jupyter environment):

1. Go to AWS Console > EMR > EMR Studio
2. Open your Studio
3. Create a new workspace linked to your EMR cluster
4. Access directly via browser without SSH tunneling
