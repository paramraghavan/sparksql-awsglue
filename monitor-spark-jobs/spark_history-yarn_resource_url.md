### **1. Universal Format:**

- Works with **any hostname** (internal AWS, public, custom DNS)
- **Simple and clear** - users just replace with their actual master node address
- **No region-specific assumptions**

### **2. Flexible Addressing:**

Users can use any of these formats:

```bash
# AWS internal hostname
http://ip-172-31-12-34.us-east-1.compute.internal:18080

# AWS public hostname  
http://ec2-54-123-45-67.us-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com:18080

# Custom DNS
http://emr-master.company.com:18080

# IP address
http://172.31.12.34:18080
```

### **3. Standard Ports:**

- **Spark History Server**: `:18080`
- **YARN ResourceManager**: `:8088`

### **4. Clear Instructions:**

The placeholder makes it obvious that users need to:

1. Replace `your-cluster-master` with their actual master node address
2. Keep the standard port numbers (18080 for Spark, 8088 for YARN)

This format is much more practical and will work across different EMR configurations, DNS setups, and network
environments. Thanks for the correction!
